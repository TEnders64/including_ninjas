	<p>Greetings! My name's Charlie. I'm a web developer and apprentice instructor here at Coding Dojo.</p>
	<p>I decided to learn how to code after a career in financial journalism, and absolutely love it. There are very few activities that put me into that "flow" mindset where time melts away and complete focus comes naturally -- computer programming turns out to be one of them.</p>
	<p>I hope everyone is as excited as am to build and deploy applications in the LAMP stack. It's going to be a struggle at times, but if you consistently put in the hours -- and that means finding time <em>each day</em> to code -- mastery will come.</p>
